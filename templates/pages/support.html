                 You can create content on Pandorabox in a variety of formats, such as Shorts, Live, and feature-length, and we do our best to make sure the creators who make it get paid. The PandoraBox Partner Program not only opens up qualified creators to use various monetization tools, but also provides one-on-one support services and Copyright Match Tool. Many channels rely on their own production teams and complete operating procedures to create successful careers on the platform.
